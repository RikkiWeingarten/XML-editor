# XML Editor

This XML editor is a tiny demo (kind of useless) developed by Vue.js , aimming to improve my kownledge and proficiency of Vue.js , reinfocing the basic of Vue.js in my mind .


I'm a student and I have no idea how to write the codes in a right style or production class .If you have any ideas or opinions about this demo ( UI/Coding Style/Vue's usage, engineering structure, etc.) I will be very appreciate if you could  spare some time to let me know/lead me to the right way.

My email is 504415750@qq.com

## Functions
Now this demo has the following functions: 
+ import / export XML files;
+ delete / add single tag;
+ delete / add / edit single tag's attributes;

I will soon update some new functions , like editing the textContent right on the tags rather than in the attributes sidebar ,  making some more function buttons...
